# Data Acquisition and Manipulation with Python [Video]
This is the code repository for [Data Acquisition and Manipulation with Python [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/data-acquisition-and-manipulation-python-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788291415), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Python, a multi-paradigm programming language, has become the language of choice for data scientists for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

In this course, you’ll start by learning how to acquire data from the web in its already “clean” format, such as in a .csv file, or a database. You’ll then learn to transform this data so it’s in its most useful format for analysis. After that, you’ll dive into data aggregation and grouping, where you’ll learn to group similar data for easier analysis purposes. 
From there, you’ll be shown different methods of web scraping using Python. Finally, you’ll learn to extract large amounts of data using BeautifulSoup, as well as work with Selenium and Scrapy.
